# rseismNet R Package
Earthquake Frequency-Magnitude Distribution & Network Statistics

Investigating the properties of the earthquake frequency-magnitude
    distribution (FMD) is the first necessary step of any seismicity analysis. The
    R package rseismNet provides a suite of statistical functions to determine the
    completeness magnitude mc and the seismicity properties below and above this
    threshold. "Net" refers to network, (1) for the seismic network properties described
    by the FMD shape below mc, and (2) for the earthquake fault network properties
    described by the Gutenberg-Richter law above mc. rseismNet also implements the
    Bayesian Magnitude of Completeness (BMC) method, which maps mc based on a seismic
    network prior.
