Title: Earthquake Frequency-Magnitude Distribution & Network Statistics
Description: A list of statistical functions to describe the earthquake frequency
    magnitude distribution (FMD). The functions follow the two following rules:
    (1) the complete FMD side (m>=mc) is governed by beta and depends on the fault
    network properties; (2) the incomplete FMD part (m<mc) is governed by kappa and
    depends on the seismic network properties (with m the earthquake magnitude and
    mc the completeness magnitude). Both beta and kappa are computed using the Aki
    approach. Any FMD shape is function of the mc spatial distribution, computed
    using the Bayesian Magnitude of Completeness (BMC) method.
