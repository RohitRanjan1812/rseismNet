Title: Earthquake Frequency-Magnitude Distribution & Network Statistics
Description: Investigating the properties of the earthquake frequency-magnitude 
    distribution (FMD) is the first necessary step of any seismicity analysis. The 
    R package rseismNet provides a suite of statistical functions to determine the 
    completeness magnitude mc and the seismicity properties below and above this 
    threshold. "Net" refers to network, (1) for the seismic network properties described 
    by the FMD shape below mc, and (2) for the earthquake fault network properties 
    described by the Gutenberg-Richter law above mc. rseismNet also implements the 
    Bayesian Magnitude of Completeness (BMC) method, which maps mc based on a seismic 
    network prior.
